## What is this?

These are software installation guides to support the book High Performance PostgreSQL for Rails.

The guides exist in the book as content, Appendixes, but are also maintained here on an ongoing basis.

If you spot bugs or want to contribute suggestions, please open an Issue or Pull Request for this repo!


## Mac OS

These installation guides are solely for Mac OS.

In the future there may be additional guides for Linux or Windows as well.


## Conventions

These are command line programs. Install them using a command line Terminal program.

Each piece of software has a corresponding Markdown file. The Table of Contents above is a list of all of the guides made from the Markdown files.

The files are intentionally kept in a flat list to make it easier to generate links to them as a Table of Contents.

Cross references exist in the files by linking to other files.
