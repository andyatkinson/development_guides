## Conventions Used Here

These are command line programs. Install them using a command line Terminal program.

Each item has it's own Markdown file covering Installation and optionally Usage. The Table of Contents lists all items and is assembled from the Markdown files.

The files are kept in a flat list to make it easier to generate the Table of Contents.
